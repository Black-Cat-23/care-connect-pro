🏥 Care-Connect Pro
AI-Assisted Hospital Information System
🚀 Overview

Care-Connect Pro is a smart, AI-assisted Hospital Information System (HIS) designed to digitize and streamline hospital operations while improving doctor–patient interaction.

Built as a national-level hackathon prototype, the platform demonstrates how modern web technologies and AI can be combined to create an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly healthcare management system.

❗ Problem Statement

Many hospitals still rely on fragmented or outdated systems that lead to:
